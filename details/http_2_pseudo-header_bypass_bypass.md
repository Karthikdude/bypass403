# HTTP/2 Pseudo-Header Bypass Bypass

# HTTP/2 Pseudo-Header Bypass Technique 🚨
## Description of the Bypass 📝
The HTTP/2 Pseudo-Header Bypass is a security bypass technique that exploits a vulnerability in the way HTTP/2 pseudo-headers are handled by some web servers and applications 🤔. Specifically, it targets the endpoint `/admin` and allows an attacker to bypass security restrictions, such as authentication and authorization checks 🚫.

## How the Bypass Occurs 🤺
The bypass occurs when an attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP/2 request to the `/admin` endpoint, which includes a pseudo-header that overrides the actual request headers 📝. This can be done by adding a `:path` pseudo-header with a value that points to a restricted resource, while keeping the actual `Path` header pointing to a non-restricted resource 🔄. For example:
* The attacker sends an HTTP/2 request with a `:path` pseudo-header set to `/admin/dashboard`
* The actual `Path` header is set to `/public/index`
* The server processes the request and grants access to the restricted resource `/admin/dashboard` due to the pseudo-header override 🚪

## How to Identify the Bypass 🔍
To identify if your application is vulnerable to the HTTP/2 Pseudo-Header Bypass, look for the following signs:
* Unusual traffic patterns or requests to the `/admin` endpoint 📊
* Unexpected access to restricted resources or functionality 🔒
* Logs showing requests with overridden pseudo-headers 📝
* Use tools like Wireshark or Burp Suite to inspect and analyze HTTP/2 traffic 🚀

## Potential Security Risks 🚨
The HTTP/2 Pseudo-Header Bypass technique poses significant security risks, including:
* **Unauthorized access** to restricted resources and functionality 🔓
* **Data breaches** due to exposure of sensitive information 📁
* **Lateral movement** within the application or network 🔄
* **Escalation of privileges** for attackers to gain higher levels of access 🔝

## How to Fix or Mitigate the Issue 🛠️
To fix or mitigate the HTTP/2 Pseudo-Header Bypass, follow these steps:
* **Update and patch** your web server and application software to the latest versions 📈
* **Configure** your web server to properly handle and validate HTTP/2 pseudo-headers 📊
* **Implement** additional security controls, such as authentication and authorization checks, to restrict access to sensitive resources 🔒
* **Monitor** and analyze traffic to detect and respond to potential bypass attempts 🔍

## Additional Notes and Best Practices 📝
* **Stay informed** about the latest security vulnerabilities and bypass techniques 📚
* **Regularly test** and assess your application's security posture 🚀
* **Implement** a defense-in-depth approach to security, with multiple layers of controls and protections 🛡️
* **Use** secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS, to encrypt and protect data in transit 📲
